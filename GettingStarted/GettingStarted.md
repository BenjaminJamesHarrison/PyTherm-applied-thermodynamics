# Getting Started

So this is our repository of open source computational resources for students of thermodynamics,
our target audience are students that may yet not know what github or python is, so we will present brief introductions of these and point to some tutorial material on them.

So, first of all, GitHub is this website < https://github.com/ > where you are most likely reading this text.
This site provides hosting of source codes in various programming languages and reading material for code developers (students, researchers, engineers), including ours. You can always read more about it on wikipedia < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub >.

The content you will see here is developed or adapted from cited sources and curated by us members of this research group. We are always accepting indirect sugestions or direct contributions.

We are developing our material in the python programming language < https://www.python.org/ >, through the jupyter notebook interface < http://jupyter.org/ >.
If you are not familiar with these tools, Python is a programming language that works some libraries for numerical methods (numpy), symbolic algebra (sympy) and graphical plots (matplotlib) comparable to Matlab.
While jupyter notebook is a browser based interface for developing python codes, with intercalating blocks of descriptive documentation and graphical results, for easy exposition of the code and underlying ideas in an educational material.
You can browse through our material here in github from a internet browser in your PC or phone, simply click each \*.ipynb file and let github render its graphical visualization including pre-calulated results.
You can also interact with them directly, modify them, changing inputs or instructions and seeing how results change along. For that you have to download each file and run then in a jupyter notebook execution in your own device. The easyest way of installing jupyter notebook, along with python/numpy/sympy/matplotlib is throug Anaconda < https://www.continuum.io > -- it's free
To get involved further, you can contribute with modifications, for that purpose you will need to create an account in github -- also free, for minor propositions, you could modify any file in the browser and click "commit", however, for submission of more complex modifications (a modification that afects simultaneously more than one file),  you should better isntall Git tools < https://git-scm.com/ > -- git is a software for version control oc code and text -- free too -- this way you can download our \*.ipynb files, run and edit them in an execution of jupyter notebook in your device, and when done, submit the modified files to our repository in github using gittools.
  
I  will now just expose the main steps here in a minimalist way to start running the codes provided in this repo     
  
#Levels of 'getting involved'

##Level 1 - just reading
brwose through \*ipynb files directly from your brwoser and see our examples of applied thermodynamics as you would in a textbook

##Level 2 - interacting
install the following tools
* PYTHON <>
* NUMPY <>
* SYMPY <>
* MATPLOTLIB <>
* JUPYTER <>
they are all provided in a bundle by 
* ANACONDA <>

download files and play with them

##Level 3 - contributing
create an account on github
* GITHUB <>
submit suggestions as messages in our repository page
also install Git tools
* GIT <>
and submit modified or new files

From here on, you can either jump into our material on applied thermodynamics with some orientation on pyhton and jupyter as you go. Check also our quick recipe for submiting on git/github.
or take you time on sites that explain how to get started on python and on jupyter independently,
you can also find later some free advanced tutorials on these tools
