~this is a brainstorming draft~

# Getting Started

so this is our repository of open source computational resources for students of thermodynamics,
this is developed for students that may yet not know what github or python is
so  GitHub is this website that provides hosting of our resources as well as those or many other users/scienteis/engineers etc,
while the content is developed and curated by us members of this research group, and accepting sugestions/contributions. 

you can browse through our resources and maybe interact with them directly from a internet browser in your PC/mobile, simply click each ?.ipynb file and let github render its graphical visualization

you can download these resources and modify them, for that you need Jupyter notebook enviroment to run ipynb files, which combines Python language, numpy/sympy/matplotlib libraries. the instalation of theses is provided by Anaconda -- it's free

you can also contribute sugegsting modifications
for that purpose you will need an  account in  github, for minor propositions -- also free
but you may also need to isntall Git tools < https://git-scm.com/ > -- git is a software for version control -- for submission of more complex modifications (a modification that afects simultaneously more than one file) -- free too

First of all, what is python, what is ipynb?  
    
python is a programming language with many libraaries that provide numerical methodss, analytical algebra (CAS) and graphical (as ploting and equation formating) resources  
    
jupyter is an interface that runs python source code and intercalate blocks of src with blocks of expalaining text or graphical results  
    
github renders some features of ipynb files automatically   
'From today Jupyter notebooks render in all their glory right here on GitHub.' < https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3 >   
to have more functionality you can use jupyter site, tab try it online  
it works on most browsers, including some on mobile devices as google chrome  
to have full functionality you have to install python and jupyter on your pc  
you can install it on windows or linux and i think mac too  
there is python for mobile  
i dont know if there is standalone jupyter for mobile  
some sites explain getting started on python and on jupyter  
https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/  
https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  
i will just expose the main steps here in a minimalist way to start running the codes provided in this repo
