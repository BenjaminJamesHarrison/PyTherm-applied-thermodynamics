# Intermediate's course

In this folder you will find jupyter notebooks to present solutions of usual problems in applied thermodynamics. These notebooks will be used to analyze, compare and present solutions of problems. Here we will no longer provide comments on python syntax.

This directory will act as a laboratory for analysis, development and testing of models and algorithms.

Expect here also some pure python codes for reusability in different notebooks
