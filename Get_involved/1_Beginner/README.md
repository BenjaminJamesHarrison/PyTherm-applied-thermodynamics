# Beginner codes' directory

In this folder you will find jupyter notebooks adressing simple problems in applied thermodynamics. These notebooks will expose basic concepts of applied thermodynamics along with comments on python syntax and the usage of the jupyter notebook itself.

> **DOWNLOAD**: To download a single notebook file from its directory in our repository on GitHub, i.e. [here](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/1_Beginner), follow these steps:
>- First, **click** on the **name of the notebook** that you wish to download,
>- then **Right click** on the button **Raw**,
>- choose "Save link as...", "Save target as...", etc..., depending on your browser,
>- choose any filename that you wish, but preserve the extension **`*.ipynb`**, in order for *jupyter notebook* to recognize it immediately.

## Goals

Introduce the student to some tools:
* python
* numpy
* scipy
* sympy

And at the same time analyze some phenomena in classical thermodynamics:
* properties of gases and liquids
* phase equilibra, etc..

# External references

* We plan on including some examples similar to the ones presented in [nrthermo's pvdiagram](http://nrthermo.tk/pvdiagrams/): van der Waals equation of state, the p-v diagram, the Binodal Curve, the Boyle temperature, and the Compressibility diagram. However in python with numpy/scipy/sympy and matplotlib, while they did in c with numerical recipes and independent plotting tools.
