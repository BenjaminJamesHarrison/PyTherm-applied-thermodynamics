# Beginner codes' directory

In this folder you will find jupyter notebooks adressing simple problems in applied thermodynamics. These notebooks will expose basic concepts of applied thermodynamics along with comments on python syntax and the usage of the jupyter notebook itself.

## Goals

Introduct the student to some tools:
* python
* numpy
* scipy
* sympy

And at the same time analyze some phenomena in classical thermodynamics:
* properties of gases and liquids
* phase equilibra, etc..

# External references

We plan on including some examples similar to the ones presented in [nrthermo's pvdiagram](http://nrthermo.tk/pvdiagrams/): van der Waals equation of state, the p-v diagram, the Binodal Curve, the Boyle temperature, and the Compressibility diagram. However in python with numpy/scipy/sympy and matplotlib, while they did in c with numerical recipes and independent plotting tools.
