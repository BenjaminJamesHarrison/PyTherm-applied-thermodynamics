~this is a draft~

expect the simplest thermodynamics scripts here, along with commnets on python syntax and jupyter notebook usage

goals

introduct the viewer to some tools

python
numpy
scipy
sympy

analyze some phenomena in classical thermodynamics of gases, liquids, phase equilibra, etc..

we plan on doing similar to http://nrthermo.tk/ but in python/numpy/scipy/sympy
