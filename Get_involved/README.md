# Get involved

We will organize our source codes, divided in three categories:

* The **[beginners](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/1_Beginner)** directory will host jupyter notebooks adressing simple problems in applied thermodynamics. These notebooks will expose basic concepts of applied thermodynamics along with comments on python syntax and the usage of the jupyter notebook itself.

* The **[intermediate](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/2_Intermediate)** directory will host jupyter notebooks to present solutions of usual problems in applied thermodynamics. These notebooks will be used to analyze, compare and present solutions of problems. Here we will no longer provide comments on python syntax.
This directory will act as a laboratory for analysis, development and testing of models and algorithms.
Expect here also some pure python codes for reusability in different notebooks

* The **[advanced](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/3_Advanced)** directory will host pure python codes and performance optmization tools. This directory will act as a software incubator to span independent projects or add-ons to existing projects. Expect also references to external available packages here rather than reinventions, when applicable.
