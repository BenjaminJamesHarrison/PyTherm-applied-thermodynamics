# PyTherm
Educational ipython source code for applied thermodynamics.

# Goals:

* Develop study material for beginners in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing
* Publish implementations of topics of interest in thermodynamics for intermediate level students in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing
* Develop research level packages for advanced level graduate students and researchers, in subtopics of applied thermodynamics that are missing in open source community.

**Come and see our [getting started text](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/Getting_started/0_Getting_started.md)!**

># Topics of interest in thermodynamics:
* mass balance, energy balance and the 1st law
* entropy and the 2nd law
* equations of state
* PxH diagrams
* pure substance L-V saturation point
* cycles
* critical points
* bubble point and dew point calculations
* excess gibbs energy models
* more bubble point and dew point calculations
* flash calculations
* pure solids
* stability analysis
* chemical reaction
* combustion engines
