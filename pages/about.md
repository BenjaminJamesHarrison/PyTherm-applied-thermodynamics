# About the Pytherm project

This is our project of open source computational resources for students of Applied Thermodynamics. Our target audience are students that may not yet know what *Python* is, so we will present brief introductions and point to some tutorial material on that and other tools that we require.

The content you will see here is curated by us members of this research group, and either developed by ourselves or adapted from cited sources. We are always accepting indirect suggestions as well as direct contributions.
We are developing our material in the *Python* programming language, through the *Jupyter notebook* interface. If you are not familiar with these tools, *Python* is a programming language that can work with some useful libraries for numerical methods (*numpy*), symbolic algebra (*sympy*) and graphical plots (*matplotlib*) comparable to Matlab. *Jupyter notebook*, on the other hand, is a browser based interface for developing *Python* codes, with intercalating blocks of descriptive documentation and graphical results for easy exposition of the code and underlying ideas in an educational material. Finally, *GitHub* is the website that provides hosting of open source projects from developers (students, researchers, engineers) from all around the world, including ours.

## Goals

We have divided our goals in three categories

### Accessible interactive lectures

* Development of study material for beginners in applied thermodynamics with programming / scientific computing. These materials are suitable for either undergraduate or graduate level courses.

* We are basing our project on scientific computing tools with focus on accessibility: We are developing lectures using pure python that can run on *python tutor live* on any computer with internet access, and lectures using the scipy stack on jupyter notebooks that can run on a variety of operational systems via the anaconda setup or on cloud computing supported by *myBinder*.

>- **Scipy** - the Open Source Library of Scientific Tools
>
>- **Anaconda** - the leading open data science platform powered by Python, a high performance distribution with access to over 720 packages.
>
>- **myBinder** - With Binder, you can opens those notebooks in an executable environment, making your code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere. 100% free and open source.

### Models & algorithms laboratory

* We intend to publish well documented and open source implementations of topics of interest in thermodynamics for intermediate level students in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing, with complete reference to original journal or textbook publications.

* We will host a virtual laboratory for analysis, development and testing of models and algorithms.

### Software incubator

* We will host a software incubator  to develop research level packages for advanced level graduate students and researchers  to fill gaps in the scientific literature of the open source community.

* This will span independent projects that will most likely be hosted in independent GitHub repositories, nevertheless still being part of the PyTherm project. Or even additions to existing projects.

* Expect usage of performance optimization tools and references to external available packages here rather than reinventions, when applicable.

>**Current topics of interest in our research include:**
>
>* Classical thermodynamics fundamentals
>   * Mass balance, energy balance and the 1st law
>   * Entropy and the 2nd law
>   * Chemical reaction
>   * Combustion engines
>   * PxH diagrams
>   * Pure substance L-V saturation curve
>   * Cycles
>   * Critical points
>* Molecular models  
>   * Volumetric Equations of state
>   * Excess Gibbs energy models
>   * Pure solid and solid solution phases properties models
>* Phase and reaction equilibria algorithms  
>   * Stability analysis
>   * Bubble point and dew point calculations
>   * Flash calculations
