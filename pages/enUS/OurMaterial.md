### ipynb lectures

You will also find jupyter notebooks adressing simple problems in applied thermodynamics. These notebooks will expose basic concepts of applied thermodynamics along with comments on python syntax and the usage of the jupyter notebook itself. - These will Introduce the student to some tools: python, numpy, scipy, sympy. And at the same time analyze some phenomena in classical thermodynamic, properties of gases and liquids, phase equilibra, etc..

### model & algorithms laboratory

In this folder you will find jupyter notebooks to present solutions of usual problems in applied thermodynamics. These notebooks will be used to analyze, compare and present solutions of problems. Here we will no longer provide comments on python syntax.

The notebooks may make use of code in separate python scripts or in differente languages

This directory will act as a laboratory for analysis, development and testing of models and algorithms.

* We plan on including some examples similar to the ones presented in [nrthermo's pvdiagram](http://nrthermo.tk/pvdiagrams/): van der Waals equation of state, the p-v diagram, the Binodal Curve, the Boyle temperature, and the Compressibility diagram. However in python with numpy/scipy/sympy and matplotlib, while they did in c with numerical recipes and independent plotting tools.
