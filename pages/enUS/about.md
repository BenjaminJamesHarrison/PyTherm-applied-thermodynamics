# The Pytherm project

This is our project of open source computational resources for students of Thermodynamics. Our target audience are students that may not yet know what *GitHub* or *Python* is, so we will present brief introductions and point to some tutorial material on both of them.
First of all, *GitHub* is the website that provides hosting of open source projects from developers (students, researchers, engineers) from all around the world, including us.

The content you will see here is curated by us members of this research group, and either developed by ourselves or adapted from cited sources. We are always accepting indirect suggestions and direct contributions.
We are developing our material in the *Python* programming language, through the *Jupyter notebook* interface. If you are not familiar with these tools, *Python* is a programming language that can work with some useful libraries for numerical methods (*numpy*), symbolic algebra (*sympy*) and graphical plots (*matplotlib*) comparable to Matlab. *Jupyter notebook*, on the other hand, is a browser based interface for developing *Python* codes, with intercalating blocks of descriptive documentation and graphical results for easy exposition of the code and underlying ideas in an educational material.

## Goals

### Accessible interactive lectures

* Development of study material for beginners in applied thermodynamics with programming / scientific computing.

* We are basing our project on scientific computing tools with focus on accessibility: Scipy - the Open Source Library of Scientific Tools - and Anaconda - the leading open data science platform powered by Python, a high performance distribution with access to over 720 packages.

* On our beginner level category, we are developing lectures using pure python that can run on python tutor live on any computer with internet access, and lectures using the scipy stack on jupyter notebooks that can run on a variety of operational systems via the anaconda setup.

### Models & algorithms laboratory

* Publish well documented and open source implementations of topics of interest in thermodynamics for intermediate level students in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing, with complete reference to original journal or textbook publications.

*  A virtual laboratory for analysis, development and testing of models and algorithms.

### Software incubator

* to fill gaps in the scientific literature of the open source community.

* Develop research level packages for advanced level graduate students and researchers, in subtopics of applied thermodynamics currently missing from open source community.

* Our advanced level category will act as a software incubator to span independent projects or add-ons to existing projects.

* Expect only pure python codes and performance optimization tools,

* span independent projects or add-ons to existing projects.

* Expect also references to external available packages here rather than reinventions, when applicable.

* These will most likely be hosted in independent GitHub repositories, nevertheless still being part of the PyTherm project

>**Current topics of interest in our research include:**
>
>* Classical thermodynamics fundamentals
>   * Mass balance, energy balance and the 1st law
>   * Entropy and the 2nd law
>   * Chemical reaction
>   * Combustion engines
>   * PxH diagrams
>   * Pure substance L-V saturation curve
>   * Cycles
>   * Critical points
>* Molecular models  
>   * Volumetric Equations of state
>   * Excess Gibbs energy models
>   * Pure solid and solid solution phases properties models
>* Phase and reaction equilibria algorithms  
>   * Stability analysis
>   * Bubble point and dew point calculations
>   * Flash calculations

## Results

### A graphical abstract

# Contents

## Getting Started

Reading our material is straightforward from your browser

* run ptl lecture (lecture zero) on the browser

* read our pre-calculated ipynb lectures  on the browser

* try to interact with them using binder on the browser

For these two kind of involvement just scroll to the TOC and click on the materials

Anyways, to interact with our ipynb lectures locally, you need t setup anaconda

* setup *Anaconda* to interact with our ipynb lectures locally

We prepared a Getting Started text to help interested with minimal background get started with anaconda setup [here](/pages/enUS/Getting_Started):

## Our material

access the Complete Table of Contents in one of the two formats below

1. **REad precalculTED RESULTS RENDEREND by gitHub on your browser**

[click](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/enUS/index.ipynb)

2. **Launch in interactive cloud computing supported by myBinder**

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/iurisegtovich/pytherm-applied-thermodynamics)

 (may take a while depending on the [server](http://docs.mybinder.org/faq) )

## Getting Involved

To get involved in our collaborative effort
* sign up on github
  * star
  * watch
  * fork
  * improve or develop
  * submit

We prepared a getting involved text with direction to setup github/git tools and submit stuff [here](/pages/enUS/Getting_Involved):
