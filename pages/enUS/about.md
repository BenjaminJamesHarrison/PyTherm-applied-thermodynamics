# Goals

### Accessible interactive lectures

* Development of study material for beginners in applied thermodynamics with programming / scientific computing.

* We are basing our project on scientific computing tools with focus on accessibility: Scipy - the Open Source Library of Scientific Tools - and Anaconda - the leading open data science platform powered by Python, a high performance distribution with access to over 720 packages.

* On our beginner level category, we are developing lectures using pure python that can run on python tutor live on any computer with internet access, and lectures using the scipy stack on jupyter notebooks that can run on a variety of operational systems via the anaconda setup.

### Models & algorithms laboratory

* Publish well documented and open source implementations of topics of interest in thermodynamics for intermediate level students in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing, with complete reference to original journal or textbook publications.

*  A virtual laboratory for analysis, development and testing of models and algorithms.

### Software incubator

* to fill gaps in the scientific literature of the open source community.

* Develop research level packages for advanced level graduate students and researchers, in subtopics of applied thermodynamics currently missing from open source community.

>* Our advanced level category category will act as a software incubator to span independent projects or add-ons to existing projects.

* **Current topics of interest in our research include:**
  * Education in classical thermodynamics
    * Mass balance, energy balance and the 1st law
    * Entropy and the 2nd law
    * Chemical reaction
    * Combustion engines
    * PxH diagrams
    * Pure substance L-V saturation curve
    * Cycles
    * Critical points
  * Molecular models  
    * Volumetric Equations of state
    * Excess Gibbs energy models
    * Pure solid and solid solution phases properties models
  * Phase and reaction equilibria algorithms  
    * Stability analysis
    * Bubble point and dew point calculations
    * Flash calculations

# Results

### A graphical abstract

* [1,1] ideal gas in the python tutor live

* [1,2] vdwnp in the jupyter-notebook with ipython

* [2,1] linear algebra NRTL

* [2,2] phase equilibrium diagrams

### Feedback

# Getting Started

### Requirements

* run ptl lecture (lecture zero) on the browser

* read our pre-calculated ipynb lectures

* try to interact with them using binder

### Setup

* setup anaconda to interact with ipynb lectures locally
  * on windows
  * on linux
