# About the project

![scipy plus atoms](figs/scipy-plus-atoms.PNG)

* Our main goal is to develop and publish open source interactive computational course materials for students of Applied Thermodynamics and make them widely available.

* We do so on top of the *SciPy* stack -- a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

## Read statically

![statically](figs/statically.PNG)

* Reading our material statically in web page format is straightforward from your browser:

[ > Read statically online ](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }}/blob/master/index.ipynb)

## Read interactively

 * You can also run our material remotely on myBinder. Try them also from your browser:

[< ! > Check the system status](http://mybinder.org/status)

[ >_ Main lectures - Read interactively](http://mybinder.org:/repo/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }})

## Setup locally

![locally](figs/locally.PNG)

* Download our whole content package, either as zip or as tar.

[< ZIP > Download](http://github.com/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }}/zipball/master)

[< TAR >  Download](http://github.com/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }}/tarball/master)

* To run locally and develop on top of our content, we recommend setting up Python and the SciPy stack using the anaconda distribution.
