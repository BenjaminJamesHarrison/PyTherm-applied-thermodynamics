# PyTherm

Educational ipython source code for applied thermodynamics.

# Goals:

* Develop study material for beginners in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing. 
>* **Come and see our [getting started text](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/Getting_started/0_Getting_started.md)!**
>* **Then check out our [beginner level](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/1_Beginner) material.**

* Publish well documented and open source implementations of topics of interest in thermodynamics for intermediate level students in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing, with complete reference to original journal or textbook publications.
>*  **Our [intermediate level](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/2_Intermediate) directory will act as a laboratory for analysis, development and testing of models and algorithms.**

* Develop research level packages for advanced level graduate students and researchers, in subtopics of applied thermodynamics that are missing in open source community.
>* **Our [advanced level](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/3_Advanced) directory will act as a software incubator to span independent projects or add-ons to existing projects.**

* **Current topics of interest in our research include:**
  * Education in classical thermodynamics
    * Mass balance, energy balance and the 1st law
    * Entropy and the 2nd law
    * Chemical reaction
    * Combustion engines
    * PxH diagrams
    * Pure substance L-V saturation curve
    * Cycles
    * Critical points
  * Molecular models  
    * Volumetric Equations of state
    * Excess Gibbs energy models
    * Pure solid and solid solution phases properties models
  * Phase and reaction equilibria algorithms  
    * Stability analysis
    * Bubble point and dew point calculations
    * Flash calculations
