Educational ipython source code for applied thermodynamics.

# Our project:
We have a GitHub-pages website, check it out [here]( https://iurisegtovich.github.io/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/ )!

# Repository structure:

  * optimized for nbviewer and mybinder navigation:

**See on nbviewer [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/index.ipynb)**

or

 **Launch in interactive cloud computing supported by myBinder (may take a while depending on the server**

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/iurisegtovich/pytherm-applied-thermodynamics)

	* ** mainly
	* python source codes
	* ipynb files for python sources in jupyter-notebook
	*  **but also**
	* codes in any other language as long as the code itself and the methodology used are well documented

	* divide in lectures
	* assignments
	* cheat sheets
