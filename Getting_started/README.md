# Getting started
This is our repository of open source computational resources for students of Thermodynamics. Our target audience are students that may not yet know what *GitHub* or *Python* is, so we will present brief introductions and point to some tutorial material on both of them.
First of all, *GitHub* is this website , where you are most likely reading this text. It provides hosting of open source projects from developers (students, researchers, engineers) from all around the world, including us. You can always read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).

The content you will see here is curated by us members of this research group, and either developed by ourselves or adapted from cited sources. We are always accepting indirect suggestions and direct contributions.
We are developing our material in the *Python* programming language, through the *Jupyter notebook* interface. If you are not familiar with these tools, *Python* is a programming language that can work with some useful libraries for numerical methods (*numpy*), symbolic algebra (*sympy*) and graphical plots (*matplotlib*) comparable to Matlab. *Jupyter notebook*, on the other hand, is a browser based interface for developing *Python* codes, with intercalating blocks of descriptive documentation and graphical results for easy exposition of the code and underlying ideas in an educational material.
This "getting started" material will cover three **Levels of 'getting involved'**

> **Level 1 - just reading**

> You can browse through our material here in *GitHub* from an internet browser in your personal computer or phone by simply clicking on each `*.ipynb` file and letting *GitHub* render its graphical visualization, including pre-calculated results, and see our material on applied thermodynamics as you would do in a regular formatted textbook.

> **Level 2 - interacting**

> You can also interact with them directly and modify them by changing inputs or instructions and seeing how results change along. For that, you have to download each file and run them in a *Jupyter notebook* execution in your own device. The easiest way of installing *Jupyter notebook*, along with *Python*, *numpy*, *sympy* and *matplotlib* is through the *Anaconda*  bundle (it’s free).

> **Level 3 - contributing**

> To get further involved, you can contribute with modifications. In order to do that, you will need to create an account for yourself in *GitHub* (also free). For minor propositions, you could modify any file in the browser and click "commit". However, for submission of more complex modifications (a modification that affects simultaneously more than one file), you should better install *Git* tools. *Git* is a software for version control of code and text (free too). This way you can download our `*.ipynb` files, run and edit them in an execution of *Jupyter notebook* in your device, and after modifications are done, submit the modified files to our repository in *GitHub* using *Git*.

From here, you can start reading our material (["Get involved"](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/tree/master/Get_involved/)) on applied thermodynamics. Our beginners material include some orientation on *Python* and *Jupyter notebook* as you go. Also, check out our quick recipes for [installing and running *Anaconda*](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/Getting_started/Get_going_with_Windows/1_Get_going_with_Jupyter_notebook.md), and for [submiting contributions on *GitHub*](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/Getting_started/Get_going_with_Windows/2_Get_going_with_GitHub.md), there, we present the steps to start using those tools in a windows environment. However, note that all our material in this repository is open source and should be able to run with the free tools mentioned also in a [free operating system](http://www.ubuntu.com/).

There is plenty of learning material regarding these specific tools on the web. We recommend some, in case you want to learn more, independently.
